1. Create a database called 'my_first_db'.

   use my_first_db

2. Create students collection.

   bd.createCollection("students")

3. Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
4. Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
   
   db.students.insert({name:"name1", home_state:"Palestine", lucky_number:11, birthday: {month:1, day:1, year: 1998}})
   db.students.insert({name:"name2", home_state:"Palestine", lucky_number:22, birthday: {month:1, day:2, year: 1998}})
   db.students.insert({name:"name3", home_state:"UK", lucky_number:33, birthday: {month:1, day:3, year: 1998}})
   db.students.insert({name:"name4", home_state:"Palestine", lucky_number:44, birthday: {month:1, day:4, year: 1998}})
   db.students.insert({name:"name5", home_state:"UK", lucky_number:55, birthday: {month:1, day:5, year: 1998}})


5. Get all students.
   
   db.students.find().pretty()

6. Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
 
   db.students.find({$or: [{home_state:"Palestine"}, {home_state:"UK"}]})

7. Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3

   db.students.find({luckynumber: {$gt:22}})

8. Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10

   db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte:33}})

9. Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)

   db.students.find({$and: [{lucky_number: {$gte:22}}, {lucky_number: {$lte:55} } ] } ) 

10. Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.

    db.students.update({$addToSet: {interests: {$each: ['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'] } } } )

11. Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.

    db.students.update({name: "name1"}, {$addToSet: {interests: {$each: ['Java'] } } } )
    db.students.update({name: "name2"}, {$addToSet: {interests: {$each: ['Java'] } } } )
    db.students.update({name: "name3"}, {$addToSet: {interests: {$each: ['Java'] } } } )

12. Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.

    db.students.update({name: "name4"}, {$addToSet: {interests: {$each: ['taxes'] } } } )

13. Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.

    cd.students.update({name: "name4"}, {$pull: {interests: "taxes"} } )

14. Remove all students who are from California.

    db.students.deleteMany({home_state: "Palestine"})

15. Remove a student by name.

    db.students.deleteOne({name: "name1"})

16. Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)

    db.students.deleteOne({luck_number: {$gt: 44}})

17. Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.

    db.students.updateMany({}, {$addToSet: {"number_of_belts": 0}})

18. Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).

    db.students.updateMany({home_state:"UK"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts: 1} } )

19. Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'

    db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {"number_of_belts" : "belts_earned"} }

20. Remove the 'lucky_number' field.

    db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {lucky_number: ""} } )

21. Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.

    db.students.updateMany({}, {$currentDate: {updated_on: true} } )
